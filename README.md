# IT-Systems-Visual-Explorer
This is a visualization using the Open Source D3 Javascript library to explore IT system interfaces. The goal is to make it convenient for a large enterprise to examine the interfaces within the system architecture based on the current configuration. Many tools and features will be added that make the various tasks needed more convenient and help to quickly understand the relationship and data flows between system components. A "toy" system is provided as an example, but will be able to display any system if the data is available and can be put in the right format for ingest.
